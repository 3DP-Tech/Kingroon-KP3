# Precompiled Firmware
![](https://github.com/3DP-Tech/Kingroon-KP3/raw/main/Images/screen-205.png)

You will find precompiled versions of the firmware ready for an OEM KP3. If you made any modifications to your printer, such as adding a auto bed leveler, you will need to compile the firmware.

The precompiled firmware is located in the **bin** folder.

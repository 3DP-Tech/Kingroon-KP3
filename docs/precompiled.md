# Precompiled Firmware
![](https://github.com/3DP-Tech/Kingroon-KP3/raw/main/Images/screen-205.png)

You will find precompiled versions of the firmware ready for an OEM KP3. If you made any modifications to your printer, such as adding an auto bed leveler, you will need to compile the firmware.

The precompiled firmware is located in the **bin** folder.
